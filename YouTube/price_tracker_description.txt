Title:
🧠 I Built a Costco Price Tracker in Python (as a CS Student Dad!)
Description:
In this video, I build a Costco Price Tracker from scratch using Python and BeautifulSoup.
It logs product prices, detects price drops, and saves results automatically — perfect for anyone learning to code or trying to save money!
This is my first real-world coding project as part of The CompSci RV Dad journey — studying computer science, raising kids, and living the RV life while chasing a tech career.
💻 Tech: Python, BeautifulSoup, CSV, datetime
📈 Next: add charts, email alerts, and live web scraping!
Subscribe if you love practical learning, dad energy, and simple coding wins 🚐💡
